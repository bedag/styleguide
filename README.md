# bedag.github.io/styleguide

This the public deployment of our Bedag styleguide. If you need to update it, replace the docs folder with
the output from the build in the bedag-angular-styleguide project, and change the base href in the index.html
file. The script `update.sh` does this for you; make sure `bedag-angular-styleguide` is in the same folder
as this project, is up to date and the correct branch is checked out, the script will not do that for you.
